# CSC680Final
Project Description:
I decided to work on this project by myself. 
This project aims to develop a task tracker that will allow the user to maintain an orderly lifestyle while juggling multiple tasks/activities. I decided to change my project topic from a recipe organizer to this because I felt this was something that would actually be useful in my life, since I both work fulltime and go to school it can get hectic managing all the work I have to do but an app like this could help make that load manageable. 

Note: This app is built to MacOS, a few weeks back i discussed with you how the simulator was not functioning on my laptop and I had tried everything possible. It wouldnt even recognize my phone when i tried to connect via cable. Also, my calendar view is not working within the app, but please take a look at it in preview - im pretty frustrated because its a feature i wanted to get up and running badly. 

Must-Have Features:

    Ability to add new taks: Allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
    Categorization: Enable users to categorize tasks by date.
    Search Functionality: Implement a filter that allows users to search their tasks by due date.
    Lists: Include the ability to break down tasks into subtasks, which will make it easier to digest. 
    Calendar: Provide users with a calendar view to see their tasks layed out for the upcoming month. 
    Responsive Design: Ensure the app is responsive and accessible.

Nice-to-Have Features:

    Priority Levels: Allow users to set priority levels for tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) to help them focus on the most important tasks first.
    Reminders and Notifications: Implement reminder notifications for upcoming deadlines or tasks to keep users on track.Nutritional Information: Provide nutritional information for        recipes, including calorie counts, macronutrient breakdowns, etc.
    Recurring Tasks: Enable users to create tasks that repeat at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
    Collaboration: Allow users to share tasks and collaborate with others, making it easier to manage group projects or shared responsibilities.
    
Conclusion:
This task tracking app aims to streamline the user's workflow by providing essential features for managing tasks efficiently and additional nice-to-have features to enhance productivity and personalization. With these capabilities, users can better balance their responsibilities and maintain an organized lifestyle despite their busy schedules.
